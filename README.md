## environment config

create a config file in your home directory `~/.config/.zerotier.json`

```json
{
    "default": {
        "Host": "https://my.zerotier.com",
        "Key": "your api token"
    },
}
```

for support of multiple configurations create additional top level elements in your config file and pass a matching `--env` flag with your commands

if no `--env` flag is passed the cli will load the `default` configuration

## load build harness

```sh
make init
```

## load dependencies

```sh
GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor

- GET /api/self - documented but not functional
- POST /api/auth/_logout - unsure the usefulness of this
