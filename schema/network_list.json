Tags will NOT work, and\n#               capabilities will only work if assigned to the new side.\n# new <--> new: Full rules engine support including tags and capabilities.\n#\n# We recommend upgrading all your devices to 1.2.0 as soon as convenient. Version\n# 1.2.0 also includes a significantly improved software update mechanism that is\n# turned on by default on Mac and Windows.
